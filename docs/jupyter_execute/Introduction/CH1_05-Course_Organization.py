# ## Office Hours
# Office hours are Thursday  from 2 -- 4pm 
# online with the class zoom link.
# 
# I will answer email questions in the same time slots.
# 
# ## Class and Lab
# -  Parallel to the class there is a Lab (MSE676) course.
# - We will analyze the data of the lab course, independent of whether you are participating or not,
# - For the analysis of the data we will need a labtop in class.
# 
# - Everyone needs a laptop in class
# - I need real feedback on what you guys want to do and need to learn.

# ## Homework and Quizzes
# - Homeworks and Quizzes are the main way to determine your grade in this course.
# - Homeworks have to be submitted electronically through Canvas and generally are about analyzing on your own data which are similar to those in the practice sessions.
# - Think of these homeworks as small take-home exams.
# - Additionally, there will be reading assignments every week.
# - Each week before the lecture, there will be a short quiz about the content of the reading assignments.
# - Neither the TA nor the instructor will answer questions about your homework after the deadline.
# - If you are more than two homeworks behind, you failed the class.

# ## Final
# The final is a report of how TEM will/can be used in your research.
# This should include a critical review of  data from journal articles which did TEM similar to what  you propose.

# ## Grades
# The grade is a determined by 1/3 each: final, homework, and quizzes.
